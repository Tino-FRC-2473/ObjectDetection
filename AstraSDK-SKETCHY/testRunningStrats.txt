Do not go in samples/stfl/blahblahblah and do stuff there because that just does not work

Try putting the main.cpp file into the large Astra folder

Maybe trying

g++ -std=c++11 -g main.cpp -I/home/orbbec/astra/include -L/home/orbbec/astra/build/lib/ -lastra -lastra_core -lastra_core_api 

Would make it compile?
